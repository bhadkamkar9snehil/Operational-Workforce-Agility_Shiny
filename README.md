# Operational Workforce Agility

### This project showcases:
- the various ways in which UI elements can be created dynamically using Shiny
- `Shinydashboard` package
- a **recommendation engine**
- a **matching algorithms**

It is a dashboard which solves a theoretical problem of workforce balancing. The details of the problem are given below.

> A company has *n* number of departments, each with varying number of employees. The workload for all the departments is seasonal. Workload can be quantified by *man-hours*. 
> To meet the increased demand, additional *man-hours* is required. This additional need *man-hours* can be met by either
>* hiring contractual employees
>* paying overtime to existing employees  
>
> This increases the cost overhead. 
> The goal is to reduce the extra cost incurred to meet a temporary workload increase.
> Cost is reduced by balancing the employees between the various departments to fulfill the extra demand on a temporary basis.

##### This project is a simulation of such balancing.


**Agility** in this project is defined as- Flexibility of workforce to move to different departments and fulfill demand.  

There are multiple aspects of the dashboard which are under construction.  
Various assumptions and constraints are added to the project to make it as viable as possible.
